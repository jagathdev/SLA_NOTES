Es modules

require medthod is used to import and export methods

Core Modules :-

1. file system moudle :-

we can access the files your internal local machine to access your files we have multiple
buildin functions are there. 

read,write,update and delete files and access the folders 

file upload handling and log creation. and reading the confing file store a data without DB.

csv and json file operations

fs module is used to intract.

always use import and export.

important buildin functions :-

appendFile()

appendFileSync()

mkdir()

read()

readSync()

readFile() - read a file

readlink()

rename()

rm()- remove a file

unlink() - delet a file


UTF-8 - Unified transfrmation formate


2. os moudle :-

3. path module :-

4. process and env :-

Node.js Core Modules – Interview Notes

⭐ ES Modules vs CommonJS
ES Modules (Recommended Modern Syntax)

Use import and export

Example:

import fs from "fs";
export function test() {}

CommonJS (Older Syntax)

Uses require() and module.exports

Example:

const fs = require("fs");
module.exports = { test };

🔥 Core Modules in Node.js

1️⃣ File System Module (fs)
Purpose

Used to interact with files and folders in your local machine.

Use Cases

Read / write / update / delete files

Manage folders

File uploads & logs

Config file operations

Work with CSV, JSON data

Store small data without a database

Two Types

Asynchronous (Non-blocking) → Fast, recommended

Synchronous (Blocking) → Used when execution must stop

Important Built-in FS Functions

Function	Description

appendFile()	Add data to a file (async)
appendFileSync()Add data (sync)
mkdir()		Create a folder
read()		Low-level file reading
readSync()	Sync version
readFile()	Read a file (async)
readlink()	Read symbolic link
rename()	Rename/move a file
rm()		Remove a file
unlink()	Delete a file

Character Encoding

UTF-8 → Unified Transformation Format

Standard encoding format used in most file operations.

2. OS Module (os)

Purpose

Used to get information about the system and hardware.

Common Functions

os.type() – Returns OS name

os.platform() – Returns platform (win32, linux)

os.totalmem() – Total memory

os.freemem() – Free memory

os.cpus() – CPU details

os.homedir() – Home directory

os.uptime() – System uptime

Use Cases

Monitoring tools

Logging server metrics

Load balancing decisions

3️. Path Module (path)

Purpose

Helps handle file paths safely across OS.

Important Methods
Method	Purpose
path.join()	Join paths safely
path.resolve()	Get absolute path
path.basename()	Get file name
path.extname()	Get file extension
path.dirname()	Get parent folder
Why we use path module

OS-safe

Avoids slash (/) issues

Necessary for file operations

4️. Process & Environment (process, env)
Purpose

Interact with the running Node.js process.

Important Use-Cases
Feature	Description
process.env	Access environment variables (.env files)
process.argv	Read CLI arguments
process.cwd()	Current working directory
process.exit()	Stop the process
process.memoryUsage()	Memory usage info
Common Usage Example
console.log(process.env.PORT)


Used in:

Authentication keys

API Keys

DB credentials

Environment-based configuration

Dev / Prod modes

⭐ Very Short Summary for Interview (You can speak this)

Node.js provides core modules like fs, os, path, process and env.
The fs module allows reading, writing, updating, deleting files and folders.
OS gives system-level information, Path helps handle file paths in a cross-platform way, and Process helps access environment variables and control node execution.
I use ES Modules (import/export) because Node now supports them natively.
