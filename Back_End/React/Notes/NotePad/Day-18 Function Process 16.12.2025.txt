State
1. state is a object to store your memory or datatype. 
2. store the values and when state is updated your functional component is also rerender.
3. State are mutable(changeable) - every change rerender your component.
4. state is only using in class component.

syntax:-

this.state({count:0})

when you update the state you can use setState();

then you come to the functional process you can use useState() insted of state.

useState is a hook in a react then it will do the same process of state but 
when you come to the functional component you can access you state and your state
update function in the same place that is called useState().

const[user,setUser]=useState("Jagath");

type of useState --> array holding two datas

wehn you update the state your component is rerender.

when you update the function your state will change.
