var a=10  its a expression

if statement also logical or comparison operator.

if why retrun use

For loop is very important for interview

let only use for functional program

FUNCTION

Function call
opencall ---> functionname()
eventcall ---> event =functionname

Function Return
return any value

Lecical Scope:- 

its kind of variable accesability.
whether inner function access a outer function variable

const outer=()=>{
	let a=10;
    const add =(){
    console.log(a)
      }
add()
}

Closures Functions

a function remembering a its outer scope variable. even after the outer function has finish executing.

const createAcc=()=>{
let balance=1000;
return {
const deposite=(amount)=>{
balance +=amount
console.log("Balance :" , balance)

const withdraw=(amount)=>{
   
}
}
}
}

closure function is inner function access outter function but outterfunction is not access inner function. its remember the value
closurre is used to create a private data


Tasks:-

1. for loop 3 program how to perform each line
2. higher order array methods find,filter,include,map,forEach,reduce
all method
