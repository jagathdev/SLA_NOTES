Shalow Copy and Deep Copy :-

Shalow Copy:-

spread,slice,assign

Only top level values are copied but inner objects and array not copied - instead, their reference is copied.

Example:-

let arr=[1,2,[3,4,5]]

let newarr=[...arr]

newarr[2][0]=100;
newarr[0]=10

console.log(arr)
console.log(newarr)

output :-

[ 1, 2, [ 100, 4, 5 ] ]
[ 10, 2, [ 100, 4, 5 ] ]

nested array is reference the original array so you can change nested array its also change a original array.

but you change normal array its not change the original array its a shallow copy.

Deep Copy :-(original not affcted)

structuredClone Method

want defenition 

its not affacted original array its only change a copy array.

const arr=[1,2,3,[4,5,6]] 

const deepcopy=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr)) //copy a array

console.log("deepcopy",deepcopy)

deepcopy[2]

shallow --> nest and original array affact

Deep --> original not affact
