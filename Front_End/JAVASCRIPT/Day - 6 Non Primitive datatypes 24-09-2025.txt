Hoisting Method(Error Handling Method):-

Before inizalization you call variable its undefined that medthod is called Hoisting.
 
var a;
document.write(a)
var a=10;

let and const la undefined varathu

NON PRIMITIVE DATATYPES:-

very important.

1.Array
2.object - Array of object
3.function	


Array:-

strore a multiple element in a single variable
collection of value is strore in a single variable.

let arr = [1,2,3,"datas"]

indexing element ha tha eduthukum 
0,1,2,3,4

you can access the datas using indexing elements.

let arr = [1,2,3,"datas"]

you can access the "datas"

console.log(arr[3]);

output:-

datas

2. Two dinamtional array

let arr=[["datas","js","react"],[1,2,3]]
console.log(arr[1])

output:-

datas,js,react

2. OBJECT:-
very very important topic.

structured data its stored as a key valued pair supraed in (,).keys shoud be a variable.

let obj = {name:"react",intro:"2017",subject:"js"} 
console.log(obj);

output:-

name:react,intro:2017,subject:js

obj la irunthu key  edukanum na (.) use pannanum

console.log(obj.name)---->react

nested objct:-
 
let obj = {name:"react",intro:"2017",subject:"js",obj1{name:"js",year:2022}}

console.log(obj.obj1.name)

1. Hoisting (Error Handling Related)

Definition:
Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined.

Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but not initialized, accessing them before declaration throws a ReferenceError. 
This period is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

Example with var:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10


Example with let or const:

console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;

2. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive (reference) types store collections of values or structured data.

2.1 Array

Definition: An array stores multiple values in a single variable and allows access by index.

let arr = [1, 2, 3, "datas"];
console.log(arr[3]); // "datas"


Two-dimensional array example:

let arr2D = [["datas","js","react"], [1,2,3]];
console.log(arr2D[0]); // ["datas","js","react"]
console.log(arr2D[1][2]); // 3

2.2 Object

Definition: Objects store structured data as key-value pairs. Keys are unique identifiers, and values can be of any type.

Simple object example:

let obj = {name: "react", intro: "2017", subject: "js"};
console.log(obj); 
// {name: "react", intro: "2017", subject: "js"}
console.log(obj.name); // "react"


Nested object example:

let obj = {
    name: "react",
    intro: "2017",
    subject: "js",
    obj1: {name: "js", year: 2022}
};
console.log(obj.obj1.name); // "js"

2.3 Function

Definition: Functions are reusable blocks of code. They can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
console.log(greet("Jagath")); // "Hello, Jagath"

3. Fibonacci Series

Definition: A Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …

Example – First 10 numbers:

let n = 10;
let fib = [0, 1];
for(let i = 2; i < n; i++){
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
}
console.log(fib); 
// [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

INTERVIEW BASED QUESTIONS:-


1. Hoisting

Q1. What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Answer: Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations of variables and functions to the top of their scope before execution. 
Variables declared with var are initialized with undefined, while let and const remain uninitialized (TDZ - Temporal Dead Zone).

Q2. What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
Answer: TDZ is the period between the start of a scope and when a let or const variable is initialized. 
Accessing them in TDZ causes a ReferenceError.

Q3. Can functions be hoisted?
Answer:

Function declarations are fully hoisted.

Function expressions (including arrow functions) are not hoisted.

2. Arrays

Q4. How do you access elements of an array?
Answer: By their index, starting at 0. Example: arr[0]

Q5. What is a two-dimensional array?
Answer: An array of arrays. Example: let arr = [[1,2], [3,4]]

Q6. How can you loop through an array?
Answer: Using for, for..of, forEach, or map.

Q7. How can you add/remove elements in an array?
Answer:

Add: push(), unshift()

Remove: pop(), shift()

At specific index: splice()

3. Objects

Q8. What is an object in JavaScript?
Answer: An object stores data as key-value pairs.

Q9. How do you access object properties?
Answer:

Dot notation: obj.name

Bracket notation: obj["name"]

Q10. What is a nested object?
Answer: An object that contains another object as a value. Example:

let obj = {name: "react", details: {year: 2017}};
console.log(obj.details.year); // 2017


Q11. How to clone an object?
Answer: Using Object.assign({}, obj) or spread operator {...obj}

4. Functions

Q12. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?
Answer:

Declaration: function greet(){} → hoisted

Expression: let greet = function(){} → not hoisted

Q13. Can functions be passed as arguments?
Answer: Yes, functions are first-class citizens and can be passed as callbacks.

Q14. What are arrow functions and their features?
Answer: Shorter syntax for functions. They do not have their own this, and cannot be used as constructors.

5. Fibonacci Series

Q15. How do you generate Fibonacci series in JavaScript?
Answer: Using loops or recursion.

Example (loop):

let n = 10;
let fib = [0, 1];
for(let i = 2; i < n; i++){
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
}
console.log(fib);


Q16. Difference between iterative and recursive Fibonacci implementation?
Answer:

Iterative: uses loop, efficient, less memory.

Recursive: elegant, but can cause stack overflow for large n.

6. Advanced/Tricky Questions

Q17. What will be the output?

console.log(a);
var a = 5;


Answer: undefined (due to hoisting)

Q18. What about this?

console.log(b);
let b = 5;


Answer: ReferenceError (TDZ)

Q19. How do you deep clone an object?
Answer: Using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) for simple objects

Q20. How do you destructure arrays and objects?

let arr = [1,2,3];
let [a,b] = arr; // a=1, b=2

let obj = {name:"react", year:2017};
let {name, year} = obj;
