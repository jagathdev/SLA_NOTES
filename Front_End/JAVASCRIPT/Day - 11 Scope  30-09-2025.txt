Var - Functional Scope
var is a global scope but you can declare in a fucntion its not used. that only access in a function only.

Let and Const - Block Scope :-

let a=10;
if (true){
console.log(a);
}

when you declare with in a condition let only use with in the condition . not used in outof condition.

block block ha let and const ku different different values assign pannalam.

var – Function Scope

var is function-scoped.

If you declare a variable with var inside a function, it is only accessible inside that function.

But if you declare var outside any function, it becomes global.

✅ Example:

function test() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x); // ✅ works inside the function
}
test();

console.log(x); // ❌ Error: x is not defined

let and const – Block Scope

Both let and const are block-scoped.

A "block" means anything inside { } (if, for, while, etc.).

You can’t access them outside of the block.

✅ Example:

if (true) {
  let a = 10;
  const b = 20;
  console.log(a); // ✅ 10
  console.log(b); // ✅ 20
}

console.log(a); // ❌ Error
console.log(b); // ❌ Error

Key Difference

var → function-scoped (ignores block, only cares about functions).

let & const → block-scoped (limited to { }).

In the same block, you can assign different values for let and const.

✅ Example:

let num = 5;
if (true) {
  let num = 10;   // New variable (block scoped)
  const pi = 3.14;
  console.log(num); // ✅ 10
  console.log(pi);  // ✅ 3.14
}
console.log(num); // ✅ 5

🔥 Interview Questions
1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Answer:

var → Function-scoped, can be redeclared & updated.

l
et → Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.

const → Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared (value is constant).

2. What is functional scope vs block scope?

Answer:

Functional scope → Variables declared with var are accessible throughout the function.

Block scope → Variables declared with let and const are only accessible inside { } (if, for, etc.).

3. What happens if you use var inside a block (like if)?

Answer:
It will ignore the block and still be available outside.

if (true) {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ✅ 10

4. What happens if you use let or const inside a block?

Answer:
They are not accessible outside the block.

if (true) {
  let y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // ❌ ReferenceError

5. Can you redeclare a variable with var, let, and const?

Answer:

var → Yes (re-declaration allowed).

let → ❌ No, in the same scope.

const → ❌ No, in the same scope.

6. Can you update the value of let and const?

Answer:

let → ✅ Yes, you can update.

const → ❌ No, value cannot be reassigned (but objects/arrays can be mutated).

7. What is Hoisting in var, let, and const?

Answer:

var → Hoisted and initialized with undefined.

let and const → Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone until declaration).

Example:

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 10;

8. Why is const not always "constant"?

Answer:
const prevents reassignment of the variable, but if the value is an object/array, its contents can still be changed.

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // ✅ allowed
arr = [5, 6]; // ❌ not allowed
