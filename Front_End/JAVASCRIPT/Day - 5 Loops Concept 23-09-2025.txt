1. FOR LOOP
2. WHILE LOOP
3. DO WHILE

1. FOR LOOP:- 
	A loop used when you know the no of times you want to repeat. When you vcdontion is false the lopp is stop or end. 

SYNTAX :-

FOR(INITILIZATION; CONDITION; INCREMENT/DECREMENT){
//MINIMUM 2 (;) IRUKANUM
}


REASSIGN PANRAVANGALA THA  USE PANNANUM
BEACUSE INCREMENT SO REASSIGN IRUTHA THA USE PANNA MUDIUM SO VAR AND LET USE APNNALAM. CONST DONT USE IN FOR LOOP.

Incremnt na 0 is starting value because 0+1=1 so staring value is 0
Multiply na 1 is a statng value because 0*1=0 so staring value is 1 (1*1=1) 

Example:-

for (let a=0;a<5;a++){
document.write(a);
}

// a=0,1,2,3,4

a++ ---> a=a+1

for (let a=0;a<101;a++){
    if (a%2 ===0){
        console.write(`odd number`,$ {a+" "})
    }
    console.log(a)
}

ithu error ready pannanum.

2. While Loop:-

	when you dont know the exact count but want a reapeat until the condition is true check before the condition


SYNTAX:-
	while(condition){
//code (statement) and increment and decrement
} 


example:-

let a = 0;
while(a<5){
document.write(a)
a++;
}

3. DOWHILE
	body runs atleast once even this condition is false. because, condition is checked at end only.   

special case for do while - runs atleast once even this condition is false.

SYNTAX:-

do{

}
while(condition)

example

let a=0;
do{
document.write(a);
a++;
}
while(a<5)

practice for loop

1.
for (a=10;a<=20;a++){
    console.log(a+"")
}

2.

for(age=1;age<19;age++){
    console.log(age)
}


while loop

let a=6;
while (a<10){
    console.log(a)
    a++
}


factorial 

let n=10;
let fact =1;
for (let a=1;a<=n,a++){
document.write(a);
fact=fact*a;
}

document.write(`factorial of ${n} is $(fact)`)


-------------------------------------------------------------

1. FOR LOOP

Used when you know how many times you want to repeat a task. The loop stops when the condition becomes false.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to run
}


Important Notes:

Use var or let for the loop variable. Do not use const.

a++ means a = a + 1.

Starting value depends on the operation:

Increment: start from 0 → 0+1=1

Multiplication: start from 1 → 1*1=1

Examples:

// Print numbers from 0 to 4
for (let a = 0; a < 5; a++) {
    document.write(a + " ");
}

// Print even numbers from 0 to 100
for (let a = 0; a <= 100; a++) {
    if (a % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(`Even number: ${a}`);
    }
}


Practice Examples:

// 10 to 20
for (let a = 10; a <= 20; a++) {
    console.log(a);
}

// Age 1 to 18
for (let age = 1; age < 19; age++) {
    console.log(age);
}

2. WHILE LOOP

Used when you don’t know exactly how many times the loop should run. The condition is checked before running the loop.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to run
}


Example:

let a = 0;
while (a < 5) {
    document.write(a + " ");
    a++;
}


Practice Example:

let a = 6;
while (a < 10) {
    console.log(a);
    a++;
}

3. DO WHILE LOOP

Runs the loop at least once, even if the condition is false, because the condition is checked after the loop body.

Syntax:

do {
    // code to run
} while (condition);


Example:

let a = 0;
do {
    document.write(a + " ");
    a++;
} while (a < 5);

Factorial Example

Your factorial example had a small syntax error. Correct version:

let n = 10;
let fact = 1;

for (let a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
    fact = fact * a;
}

document.write(`Factorial of ${n} is ${fact}`);


✅ Output: Factorial of 10 is 3628800


1. Theory-Based Questions

What is a loop in JavaScript?

A loop is a programming structure that repeats a block of code multiple times until a specified condition becomes false.

Name different types of loops in JavaScript.

for, while, do...while, for...in, for...of.

Difference between for, while, and do-while.

Loop Type	Condition Checked	Runs at least once?	Use Case
for	Before each iteration	❌	Known number of iterations
while	Before each iteration	❌	Unknown number of iterations
do-while	After each iteration	✅	Ensure the loop runs at least once

What is an infinite loop? How can it happen?

A loop that never ends because the condition never becomes false.

Example:

while(true) {
  console.log("Hello");
}


Why can’t we use const for a for loop counter?

Because const cannot be reassigned, and the loop counter changes on each iteration. Use let or var.

Explain pre-increment vs post-increment in a loop.

let a = 0;
console.log(a++); // prints 0 (post-increment)
console.log(++a); // prints 2 (pre-increment)

2. Practical/Programming Questions

Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}


Print all even numbers between 0 and 50.

for(let i = 0; i <= 50; i++){
    if(i % 2 === 0){
        console.log(i);
    }
}


Calculate factorial using a for loop.

let n = 5, fact = 1;
for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    fact *= i;
}
console.log(fact);


Sum of numbers from 1 to N using while loop.

let n = 10, sum = 0, i = 1;
while(i <= n){
    sum += i;
    i++;
}
console.log(sum);


Print numbers 1 to 5 using do-while loop.

let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);


Reverse a number using while loop.

let num = 12345, rev = 0;
while(num > 0){
    rev = rev * 10 + num % 10;
    num = Math.floor(num / 10);
}
console.log(rev); // 54321


Nested loops – multiplication table for 1 to 5.

for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    for(let j = 1; j <= 5; j++){
        console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${i*j}`);
    }
}

3. Interview Tips

Always explain why you use a specific loop.

Mention time complexity if relevant.

Use let/var correctly, not const, for counters.

Practice printing patterns using nested loops (common in interviews).
