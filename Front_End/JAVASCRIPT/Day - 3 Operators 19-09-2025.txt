Operators:

1. Arithmatic opertor:-

+,-,/,%

** ---> Exponenation Power poda use agum
++ ---> Increment  example X++ = X=X+1 
-- ---> Decrement  example X-- = X=X-1

banking and e commerce webpage la use agum.

2. Assienment Operator:-

only assignment process not return. its use dynamic 

= ---> assign the value
+= ---> add and assign
-= ---> subract and assign
*= ---> multiply and assign
/= ---> devide and assign
%= ---> mod and assign
**= ---> exponenation and assign

example

let totel = 500;

totel +=50;

output ----> 550 (totel=totel+50)

3. Logical Operator:-

logical operatoronly return boolean values only

	 And operator(&&) :-

true + true = ture
true + false = false
false + true = false
false + false = false

	OR Operator (||):-

true + true = ture
true + false = true
false + true = true
false + false = false

	NOT Operator (!):-

True --> False
False --> True

4. Comparison operator (==):-

(==) Equal to ---> loose comparison 

(===) Stringt equal ----> Strigt comparison 

Not-equal (!=) :-

not equal is true

Strict Equal (!==) :-


< (less then)
<= (less then are equal to)
> (greater then)
>= (greater then are equal to)

🔑 3 Types of Variable Keywords in JavaScript

var

Declaration → Allowed

Initialization → Allowed

Re-assign → Allowed

Scope → Function scope (old way, not recommended)

let

Declaration → Allowed

Initialization → Allowed

Re-assign → Allowed

Scope → Block scope (recommended for values that may change)

const

Declaration → Allowed

Initialization → Must be initialized at declaration

Re-assign → ❌ Not allowed

Scope → Block scope (used for fixed values)

⚡ Operators (4 Main Types = AACL)

1. Arithmetic Operators

+ (Addition)

- (Subtraction)

* (Multiplication)

/ (Division)

% (Modulus → remainder)

** (Exponentiation → power)

++ (Increment → x++ = x+1)

-- (Decrement → x-- = x-1)

👉 Example:

let x = 5;
x++;   // 6
x**2;  // 36

2. Assignment Operators

= → Assign

+= → Add & assign

-= → Subtract & assign

*= → Multiply & assign

/= → Divide & assign

%= → Mod & assign

**= → Exponentiation & assign

👉 Example:

let total = 500;
total += 50;   // 550

3. Comparison Operators

== → Equal to (loose, ignores type)

=== → Strict equal (checks value + type)

!= → Not equal

!== → Strict not equal

< → Less than

<= → Less than or equal to

> → Greater than

>= → Greater than or equal to

👉 Example:

5 == "5";   // true
5 === "5";  // false

4. Logical Operators

&& (AND)

true && true → true

otherwise → false

|| (OR)

false || true → true

true || false → true

true || true → true

false || false → false

! (NOT)

!true → false

!false → true

👉 Example:

let a = true, b = false;
a && b;  // false
a || b;  // true
!a;      // false


✅ Quick Memory Trick:

Variables: var, let, const

Operators: AACL = Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical


🔑 Interview Questions on JavaScript Variables & Operators
🎯 Variables (var, let, const)
1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Answer:

var → Function scope, can re-declare, can re-assign (old way, avoid).

let → Block scope, cannot re-declare, can re-assign (preferred).

const → Block scope, cannot re-declare, cannot re-assign (used for constants).

2. Why is var not recommended in modern JavaScript?

Answer:
Because var is function scoped and causes hoisting issues.
Example:

console.log(x); // undefined (not error!)
var x = 10;


👉 With let / const, this would throw an error (safer).

3. Can const objects be modified in JavaScript?

Answer:

You cannot re-assign a const object.

But you can change its properties.
Example:

const user = { name: "Ram" };
user.name = "Sam";  // ✅ allowed
user = { name: "John" }; // ❌ error

4. What is block scope vs function scope?

Answer:

Block scope → Variable exists only inside { }. (let, const)

Function scope → Variable exists inside the whole function. (var)

5. What happens if we declare a variable without var/let/const?

Answer:
It becomes a global variable (not recommended).

x = 10;  // becomes global

🎯 Operators (AACL)
6. Difference between == and === in comparison?

Answer:

== → Loose equality (performs type conversion).

=== → Strict equality (checks value + type).

Example:

5 == "5";   // true
5 === "5";  // false

7. What is the difference between ++x and x++?

Answer:

++x (pre-increment): Increases first, then returns value.

x++ (post-increment): Returns value first, then increases.

Example:

let x = 5;
console.log(++x); // 6
console.log(x++); // 6 (then x becomes 7)

8. What is the difference between = and == and ===?

Answer:

= → Assignment operator.

== → Loose equality.

=== → Strict equality.

9. Explain short-circuit evaluation with logical operators.

Answer:

In && → If the first value is false, JS skips the second.

In || → If the first value is true, JS skips the second.

Example:

false && console.log("Not executed"); // skipped
true || console.log("Not executed");  // skipped

10. What is the result of "5" + 3 and "5" - 3?

Answer:

"5" + 3 → "53" (string concatenation).

"5" - 3 → 2 (number conversion).

👉 + behaves differently because it’s also used for string concatenation.

11. What is NaN in JavaScript?

Answer:
NaN means Not a Number, but its type is "number".

console.log(typeof NaN); // number
console.log("abc" - 5);  // NaN

12. What is the difference between null and undefined?

Answer:

null → Assigned value, represents "nothing".

undefined → Default for uninitialized variables.

Example:

let a;
console.log(a);   // undefined
let b = null;
console.log(b);   // null

13. What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?

Answer:

&& (AND) → True if all are true.

|| (OR) → True if at least one is true.

14. What is operator precedence?

Answer:
Operator precedence decides which operator runs first.
Example:

let result = 5 + 3 * 2; // 11 (multiplication first, then addition)

15. Trick Question ⚡ What is the output?
console.log(0 == false);   // ?
console.log(0 === false);  // ?


Answer:

0 == false → true (because type conversion).

0 === false → false (different types: number vs boolean).

✅ Quick Revision Points (for Interview):

Remember var vs let vs const differences.

const objects can mutate but cannot be reassigned.

== vs === is a hot interview question.

"5" + 3 vs "5" - 3 (string vs number conversion).

7 falsy values: false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN.

Short-circuit evaluation is often asked.
