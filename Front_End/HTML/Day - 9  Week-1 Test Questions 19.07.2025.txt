1. What is HTML?
Full Form: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
Purpose in Web Development:
 HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, videos, and more on a web page.
 Example: You use HTML to create headings, paragraphs, tables, and to link different web pages together.

2. What are the attributes of the <img> tag?
The <img> tag is used to display images in a web page. It has several important attributes:
src (source): Specifies the path or URL of the image file.
 Example: <img src="photo.jpg">
alt (alternative text): Provides text description of the image if it doesn't load or for screen readers.
 Example: <img src="photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
width and height: Set the dimensions of the image.
 Example: <img src="photo.jpg" width="300" height="200">

3. What are block-level elements and inline elements in HTML?
Block-level elements: Start on a new line and take up the full width available.
 Examples:


<div> – for dividing sections
<p> – paragraph text
Inline elements: Stay within the same line as surrounding content.
 Examples:


<span> – for styling part of a sentence
<a> – for hyperlinks

4. What is the difference between <div> and <span> tags?
<div> (block-level): Used to group larger sections like paragraphs, images, or other elements. It creates structure.
 Use when you want to organize your layout.
 Example: Wrapping a whole product card or a section of a webpage.


<span> (inline-level): Used to style or target smaller parts of text inside a line without breaking the flow.
 Use for styling words or small pieces inside a sentence.
 Example: Making one word bold or red inside a paragraph.
