What Are Bootstrap Cards?

Cards are flexible, extensible content containers that can hold images, headers, text, links, buttons, list groups, and more.

Built with Flexbox, they adapt well to various layouts and integrate seamlessly with Bootstrap's grid system.

Responsive Layout with Cards

Use the Grid system—like .row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3 g-4—to create a responsive card layout that naturally adjusts columns per screen size.

Add .h-100 to make cards equal height, especially useful in card groups.

You can also apply fixed width if needed, centering with mx-auto for display consistency.

Example: Bootstrap Responsive Cards Layout

Below is a polished, responsive card layout snippet—perfect for showcasing products like on Myntra:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Responsive Cards</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container py-4">
    <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 row-cols-md-3 row-cols-lg-4 g-4">
      <!-- Card Loop (copy for each product) -->
      <div class="col">
        <div class="card h-100">
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" class="card-img-top" alt="Product Image">
          <div class="card-body d-flex flex-column">
            <h5 class="card-title">Product Name</h5>
            <p class="card-text flex-grow-1">Short description for the product goes here.</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary mt-auto">Buy Now</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Repeat cards as needed -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Why This Works Well

Responsive Grid: Adapts to multiple breakpoints for various device sizes.

Equal Height Cards: .h-100 ensures uniform height.

Flexible Content Layout: Using d-flex and mt-auto lets buttons stick to the bottom for consistent card appearance.

Enhancement for Your products.html

If you replace your existing markup with the above structure, you’ll immediately improve visual consistency and responsiveness—especially:

Use actual product images and names.

Repeat the card markup for each product in the grid.
